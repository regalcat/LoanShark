INTRODUCTION:

	Loan Shark is a piece of book-cataloguing software that you
	can use to keep track of what books you own, where they are
	located, and who you're loaning them out to. Its strength 
	lies in its simplicity of use and navigation, and should 
	take mere moments to install and get up and running. We hope
	you enjoy our software!

INSTALLATION:

	To install, simply download the installer, click 'next', and

HOW TO USE:
	
	FILE MENU:

		ADD:
			Clicking add will open a new window that
			allows you to fill in the fields for a new
			book, which will then be added to your library.

		LOAD:
			Load causes the program to set the current
			list of books to whatever is in the xml file.
			If the library has not been saved since any
			changes have been made, this will have the effect
			of resetting the library.

		SAVE:
			Save causes the xml file supporting the library
			to be updated with the current version of the 
			library. 

	SETTINGS MENU:
		
		This will allow you to view different color themes
		that you can use to customize your visual experience
		of Loan Shark. Pick your favorite!

	VIEW FILTERS:

		SHOW FAVORITES:
			This filter allows you to change the tile 
			view to only include books you marked as
			"favorite" in the add/edit screen.

		SHOW LOANED:
			This filter allows you to change the tile 
			view to only include books that you have
			loaned out.

		SHOW ALL:
			This filter removes the effects of other 
			filters and allows you to view all your 
			books.

	SEARCH BAR:

		Typing a word into this text area will change the 
		tile view to only include books that have a field
		that includes that word. (The "description" field
		is especially useful in conjunction with the search
		bar, as it allows you to essentially tag items with
		a particularly memorable word that you can find them
		later.)

	RIGHT-CLICK TILE:

		LOAN:
			Pressing this will allow you to loan out that
			book, after putting in a name and the date
			that the book was loaned out at.

		EDIT:
			This allows you to change any field of the
			selected book after you initially set it.

		REMOVE:
			This allows you to remove a book from your
			library.

	LEFT-CLICK TILE:

		Left-clicking a tile will cause its fields to appear
		in the sidebar for reference.
